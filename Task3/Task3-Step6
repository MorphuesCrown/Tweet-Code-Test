Hypothesis: The determinants of the difference between network and engagement overlaps in the context of influencers can be attributed to several factors, including content diversity, audience segmentation, and algorithmic influence.

1. Content Diversity: Influencers with high network overlap but low engagement overlap may have a diverse range of content that appeals to a broader audience. Their network may include a large number of followers who are interested in various aspects of their content. However, the engagement overlap might be lower because different segments of their audience engage more with specific types of content, resulting in a lower overall engagement overlap.

2. Audience Segmentation: Influencers with high engagement overlap but low network overlap may have a more niche or specialized content focus that resonates strongly with a specific segment of their audience. Their engagement overlap could be high because the content they produce attracts a dedicated and engaged fan base. However, the network overlap might be lower because their content does not necessarily appeal to a broader audience outside of their core followers.

3. Algorithmic Influence: The algorithms used by social media platforms play a significant role in determining the visibility and reach of influencer content. In some cases, influencers with high network overlap but low engagement overlap might benefit from algorithmic exposure, such as being recommended to new users or appearing in trending sections. This exposure can lead to a larger network but may not necessarily translate into high engagement if the content does not resonate strongly with the broader audience. Conversely, influencers with high engagement overlap but low network overlap may have content that is favored by the algorithms for engagement metrics, resulting in higher engagement rates but limited network expansion.
